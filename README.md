This is the first core course for first-year PhD students in macroeconomic theory taught at the University of Florida. Part one covers the dynamic programming theory, including dynamic exchange economies, neoclassical growth models,  (practical) deterministic and stochastic dynamic programming, and three applications in asset pricing, consumption-saving, and job search, respectively. Part two covers applications of major topics, including overlapping generation, real business cycles, menu costs and sticky prices, and fiscal and monetary policies. The organization of this course benefits and inherits a lot from other first-year PhD courses taught by Chris Edmond, Dirk Krueger, Eric Sims, and JÃ³n Steinsson.
